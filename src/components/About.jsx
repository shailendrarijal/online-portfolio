              <p>
                Thank you for visiting my website. Following my passion toward web development, I started with HTML, CSS and gradually learned SQL, PHP, BootStrap, JavaScript, NodeJS, Express and React. Applying my skills, I have created some websites which you can find in the projects section. My recent learning was a bootcamp with a developer Angela Yu from Udemy where I learnt about numerous applications as well as learnt how to search for solutions.
